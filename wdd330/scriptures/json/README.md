Notes
These JSON editions do not include copyrighted material (footnotes, chapter summaries, the Book of Mormon introduction, etc.).
The Book of Mormon text comes from the Mormon Documentation Project SQLite file (from December 2011, though I compared the exported text to the latest 2013 version and there were no differences). I exported the text, added additional content (title page, the book/chapter headings that were in the original text, testimonies), and made the adjustments from the 2013 edition (which are small enough in relation to the whole that they don't fall under copyright, being minor typographic fixes, not anything substantial).
The text for the Doctrine & Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, Old Testament, and New Testament comes from the 2013 version of the Mormon Documentation Project SQLite file. I exported the text, added title page information, and made the 2013 adjustments.
The flat editions are intended for easy iteration through verses, for textual/linguistic analysis or other similar domains. Not included: title pages, testimonies, LDS.org slugs, etc.
The reference editions are intended for easy reference in code (data['1 Nephi']['3']['7], for example). Not included: title pages, testimonies, LDS.org slugs, etc.
Typographical note: Small caps are rendered as all caps, and italics are not distinguished. (I'm still trying to figure out the best way to handle formatting. At this point, I'm leaning toward having a formatted property with a copy of the verse text, using some kind of XML for formatting -- and it <i>came</i> to pass, saith the <smcp>Lord</smcp> God, or something like that.) Curly quotes have been straightened, though I'm already having second thoughts about that.
