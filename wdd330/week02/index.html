        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>
          When you use const in front of a variable, it won't be assigned to
          another variable of the same kind. When you use let in front of a
          variable. it can be changed at any time. If you try to do it on
          purpose or by accident, you will get an error, "<b
            ><< TypeError: Assignment to constant variable</b
          >". <br /><br />
          While in the console, you can type <b>typeof</b> in front of the
          variable to find out what type of variable is. <br /><br />
          For example if the following was true:
          <b>const firstName = "Jesse";</b> then it would come back with string.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can declair more than one variable at a time.For example, you
          could write a line of code as:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; <b>let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Above it says you cannot change the value of the variable if you use
          const in front of it but it is possible to accomplish. If const is
          used with an array, the values within the array can be changed.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; <b>const name = { value: 'Alexa'};</b> // This is an object.
          <br /><br />
          You can change the value within the array by typing the follow:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; <b>name.value = 'Siri';</b> // Change the value. <br /><br />
          You cannot change the value by typing:
          <b>const name = { value: 'Siri'};</b>
          <br />
          It would come back with the same error when you tried to change a
          const variable, "<b><< TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.</b
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Using const and let to declare variables that are not inside of a
          block '{ }' and can be accessed throughout the program would be
          considered a Gobal Scope. If a variable is found inside of a block it
          is considered a local scope. It can only affect anything inside the
          function. If const or let are not used in a block it can be used
          inside or outside a block. To prevent peoblems, always use const or
          let with your variables.

        <h2>Converting Strings to Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          Strings can be converted to numbers:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; <b>Number('23');</b> the number 23 would be returned.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; <b>const answer = '5' * 1;</b> the number 5 would be returned.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; <b>const answer = + '5';</b> 5 would be returned. If you used
          <b>typeof</b> infront of the variable 'answer', the "number" would be
          returned. <br /><br />
          If you tried <b>Number('hello')</b> NaN would be returned.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Converting Numbers to Strings</h2>
        <p>
          Numbers can be converted to strings:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; String(3); // would result with the return of '3'.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; 3 + '3'; // would result with the return of '3'.
          <br /><br />
          You can even use the method toString() to convert numbers to strings:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; 10..toString(); // would return '10'. The empty() writes the
          number 10 in binary base two.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; 10..toString(2); // would return '1010' because (2) writes the
          number in binary base 10.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; 28101.toString(36); // would return 'lol' because after base 10
          letters are used to represent the digits.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Parsing Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          Converts from binary , back to decimal:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; parseInt('1010',2); // returns 10
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; parseInt('omg',36); // returns 31912
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; parseInt('23',10); // returns 23
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; parseInt('211B Baker Street',10)// returns 221 because the
          string started with a number and the letters after will be ignored.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; parseInt('2.4',10); // returns 2 because everything after the
          decimal will be removed.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; parseFloat('2.9',10); // returns 2.9
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Template Literals</h2>
        <p>
          Template literals use the backtick character,` , to deliminate the
          string. It can be used when you need to show the single quote or
          double quote in a sentence:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; `She said, "It's Me!"`
          <br /><br />
          It can also be used in code:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; const name = `Siri`;
          <br />
          &emsp; `Hello ${ name }!`; &emsp; // Which would return `Hello Siri!`
          <br /><br /><br />
          &emsp; const age = 38;
          <br />
          &emsp; `I will be ${ age + 1 } next year`; // Which would return `I
          will be 40 next year`
          <br /><br />
          Template literals can also contain line breaks:
          <br /><br />
          `This is the first line ...
          <br /><br /><br />
          ... and this is the last line`
          <br /><br />
          The result would look like this:
          <br /><br />
          `This is the first line ... \n\n\n... and this is the last line`
          <br /><br />
          Just a little note: This, \`, is also a backtick.

        <h1>Notes from JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 3:</h1>
        <h2>Arrays, Logic, & Loops</h2>
        <p>
          An array is an ordered list of values. An array can be created:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; const heros = []; // This is an empty array
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; const heros = new Array(); // This is an array constructor
          function
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; heros(0); // Returns undefined if there 0 in the array has no
          value
          <br /><br />
          You can add values to an array or change a value or values by using
          the following:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; heros[0] = 'Superman';
          <br />
          &emsp; heros[1] = 'Wonder Woman';
          <br />
          &emsp; heros[2] = 'Flash';
          <br /><br />
          If you added heros[5] = 'Aquaman'; and skipped heros[3] & heros[4],
          they would be undefined within the array until they are defined.
          <br /><br />
          You can also create array literals:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; const avengers = ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor',
          'Hulk']
          <br /><br />
          You can also create arrays with different data types:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; const mixedArray = [null, 1, [], 'two', true];
          <br /><br />
          You can delete a value from the array:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; delete avengers[3]; // This would delete 'Hulk' from the array
          and avengers[3] would not be undefined.
          <br /><br />
          If you typed avengers you would get:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', undefined]
          <br /><br />
          If you wanted to show one of the avengers names you would type:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; avengers[2]; // This would return 'Thor'
          <br /><br />
          You can swap the values of two variables:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; const temp = x; &emsp; x = y; &emsp; y = temp;
          <br /><br />
          Here are some of the things you can do with arrays. We will use the
          following code to work with:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; const avengers = ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor',
          'Hulk', 'Hawkeye', 'Black Widow'];
          <br /><br />
          You can see what then length of the array is:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; avengers.length; // This returns 6 and if you subtrack 1 from
          the length, it would give you the amount of values in the array.
          <br /><br />
          You can use the length to find out the last value in the array:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; avengers[avengers.length - 1]; // This would return 'Black
          Widow'
          <br /><br />
          You can change the length of the array by setting the length of it:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; avengers.length = 8 // This would return ['Captain America',
          'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'Hawkeye', 'Black Widow', undefined,
          undefined]
          <br /><br />
          You can shorted the array but any elements beyond that length will be
          removed.
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; avengers.length = 3; // This would return ['Captain America',
          'Iron Man', 'Thor']
          <br /><br />
          You can remove the last item in an array, if the following code was
          used:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; avengers.pop(); // the array would now look like this ['Captain
          America', 'Iron Man']
          <br /><br />
          If you wanted to remove the first item in the list (using the array
          just mentioned):
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; avengers.shift(); // the array would look like this ['Iron
          Man', 'Thor']
          <br /><br />
          If you wanted to add an item to the end of the list (using the array
          just used):
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; avengers.push('Hulk'); // the array would look like this
          ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk']
          <br /><br />
          If you wanted to add a new item to the beginning of an array (using
          the above array):
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; avengers.unshift('Black Widow'); // the array would look like
          this ['Black Widow, 'Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor']
        </p>
      </div>
