        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>
          When you use const in front of a variable, it won't be assigned to
          another variable of the same kind. When you use let in front of a
          variable. it can be changed at any time. If you try to do it on
          purpose or by accident, you will get an error, "<b
            ><< TypeError: Assignment to constant variable</b
          >". <br /><br />
          While in the console, you can type <b>typeof</b> in front of the
          variable to find out what type of variable is. <br /><br />
          For example if the following was true:
          <b>const firstName = "Jesse";</b> then it would come back with string.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can declair more than one variable at a time.For example, you
          could write a line of code as:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; <b>let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Above it says you cannot change the value of the variable if you use
          const in front of it but it is possible to accomplish. If const is
          used with an array, the values within the array can be changed.
          <br /><br />
          <b>const name = { value: 'Alexa'};</b> // This is an object.
          <br /><br />
          You can change the value within the array by typing the follow:
          <br /><br />
          &emsp; <b>name.value = 'Siri';</b> // Change the value. <br /><br />
          You cannot change the value by typing:
          <b>const name = { value: 'Siri'};</b>
          <br />
          It would come back with the same error when you tried to change a
          const variable, "<b><< TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.</b
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Using const and let to declare variables that are not inside of a
          block '{ }' and can be accessed throughout the program would be
          considered a Gobal Scope. If a variable is found inside of a block it
          is considered a local scope. It can only affect anything inside the
          function. If const or let are not used in a block it can be used
          inside or outside a block. To prevent peoblems, always use const or
          let with your variables.
