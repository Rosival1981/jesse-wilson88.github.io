          Notes from

            >Object methods, "this":</a

        </h1>
        <h2>Method examples:</h2>
        <p>
          Object are usually created to represent entities of the real world.
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>let user = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
    };</b>
          </pre>
        <p>
          The first example that is used with the object user is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>let user = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };
  
    user.sayHi = function() {
      alert("Hello!");
    };
  
    user.sayHi();</b> // Hello!
          </pre>
        <p>
          If there is only one object, you can use 'user'. If there are more
          than one object, you should to use 'this' instead or you will get an
          error.
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>let user = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      sayHi() {
        alert( user.name );</b> // leads to an error
      <b>}

    };
    
    let admin = user;

    user = null;</b> // overwrite to make things obvious
    <b>admin.sayHi();</b> // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
          </pre>
        If you were to replace <b>user.name</b> with <b>this.name</b> it would
        work just fine.
        <p>
          I do no really understand this next example. It says the value of this
          is evaluated during the run-time and depends on the context. It also
          says the same function is assigned to two different objects and had
          different "this" in the calls. I do not understand how this works yet.
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>let user = { name: "John" };
    let admin = { name: "Admin" };
  
    function sayHi() {
      alert( this.name );
    }</b>
  
    // use the same function in two objects
    <b>user.f = sayHi;
    admin.f = sayHi;</b>
  
    // these calls have different this
    // "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
    <b>user.f();</b> // John  (this == user)
    <b>admin.f();</b> // Admin  (this == admin)
  
    <b>admin['f']()</b>; // Admin (dot or square ackets access the method – doesn't matter)
          </pre>
        <p>
          This next example is interesting. the object is user and and at the
          end user.sayHi() is called. In the sayHi() function this is used
          instead of user. I wonder if it is because this.firstName is more like
          an argument so it does not matter what is passed to it. It is cool
          seeing the arror function used in it.
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>let user = {
      firstName: "Ilya",
      sayHi() {
        let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
        arrow();
      }
    };
  
    user.sayHi();</b> // Ilya
          </pre>
        <p>
          I like this next example. I like seeing how the functions are called.
          I just wonder if how you could have the output something like 5 - 6 =
          -1 instead of just the numbers.
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>let calculator = {
      sum() {
        console.log(`${this.a} + ${this.b} = `);
        return this.a + this.b;
      },
  
      mul() {
        console.log(`${this.a} * ${this.b} = `);
        return this.a * this.b;
      },
  
      pre() {
        console.log(`${this.a} / ${this.b} = `);
        return this.a / this.b;
      },
  
      sub() {
        console.log(`${this.a} - ${this.b} = `);
        return this.a - this.b;
      },
  
      read() {
        this.a = +prompt('a?', 0);
        this.b = +prompt('b?', 0);
      }
    };
    
    calculator.read();
    console.log( `${calculator.sum()` );
    console.log( `${calculator.mul()` );
    console.log( `${calculator.pre()` );
    console.log( `${calculator.sub()` );</b>
    
    5 + 5 = 
    10
    5 * 5 = 
    25
    5 / 5 = 
    1
    5 - 5 = 
    0
          </pre>
        <p>
          With the help of a Chris Blunt ,a classmate from last semester. We
          were able to talk through this and figured out how to add text and
          show the value. Now I just have to figure how to have an output look
          this below. Maybe it can by updating a pre using JavaScript. <br />
          10 + 5 = 15 <br />
          10 * 5 = 50 <br />
          10 / 5 = 2 <br />
          10 - 5 = 5 <br />
          I am not 100% sure how this works but after really looking at the
          calculator variable. At first I thought it only had the sum) function
          inside it. After looking at it in the website, I realized calculator
          is an array, so it makes a little more sense. I hope I get a better
          understanding of what I am doing with these objects.

        <h2>Objects</h2>
        <p>
          I don't understand what an object or how it worked and I may still not
          completely understand but I think I am getting there. After talking to
          another classmate and getting an idea what they understood, I went
          back to reading the beginning of chapter 5 and I think I figured it
          out. We will see. To hopefully help with the what an object is, here
          is what I found about Functions & Objects. Here is a description of a
          funcition I found on the
          <a
            href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/javascript_functions.htm"
            >tutorials point</a
          >
          web site. A <b>function</b> is a group of reusable code which can be
          called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of writing
          the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular
          codes. Functions allow a programmer to preide a big program into a
          number of small and manageable functions. Here is a what
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects"
            >MDN Web Docs</a
          >
          says about objects. In JavaScript, an <b>Object</b> is a standalone
          entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example.
          A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design,
          weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript
          objects can have properties, which define their characteristics. In
          the book it says, An <b>Object</b> in JavaScript is a self-contained
          set of related values and functions. They act as a collection of named
          properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers,
          booleans, arrays and functions. If a property’s value is a function,
          it is known as a method. It also says that it is like a database of
          values. Here are a couple of examples of objects:
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>const spiderman = { };
        spiderman.name = "Spider-Man";
        spiderman.realName = "Peter Parker";
      
        console.log(spiderman);
      
        returns:
      
        {
          name:"Spider-Man",
          realName:"Peter Parker"
        }</b>
          </pre>
        <p>Here are a few examples how you can create object:</p>
        <pre>
    <b>const superman = {
            name: 'Superman',
            'real name': 'Clark Kent',
            height: 75,
            weight: 235,
            hero: true,
            villain: false,
            allies: ['Batman','Supergirl','Superboy'],
            fly() {
              return 'Up, up and away!';
            }
          };</b>
          </pre>
        <p>Here are some examples of creating objects:</p>
        <pre>
      <b>const spiderman = { };</b> // an empty object assigned to the varible spiderman
    
      <b>const spiderman = new Object( );</b> // This is also creating an empty object
    
      <b>const ironMan = { name, realName };</b> // the short ES6 way
          </pre>
        <p>
          I talked with Chris Blunt from another class to see if he could help
          me understand a little better about objects and how to get an element
          back from an object (if that is the correct way to say it.)
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>const spiderman = {
            name: "Spider-Man",
            realName: "Peter Parker"
          };
        
      const ironman = {
        name: "Iron Man",
        realName: "Tony Stark"
      };
    
      function reveal() {
        return this.realName;
      }
    
        spiderman.f = reveal;
        ironman.f = reveal;
      </b>
            
      <b>document.getElementById('test').innerHTML = ironman.f();</b>
    
      <b>console.log(spiderman.f());</b> // returns Spider-Man
    
      <b>console.log(ironman.f());</b> // returns Iron Man
          </pre>
        <p>
          Or try it with an array. I am still not understanding 100% but it did
          help a little bit. I will look at these again. Here is the other way
          we did the above. This was done by replacing a pre with an ID in the
          HTML file.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>const superhero = [
          {name: "Spider-Man",
          realName: "Peter Parker"},
      
          {name: "Iron Man",
          realName: "Tony Stark"}
        ]
      </b>
      <b>document.getElementById('test').innerHTML = superhero[1].name;</b> //This will return 'Iron Man'. Change 1 to 0 and it would return 'Spider-Man'
    
      <b>console.log(superhero[0].name);</b> // returns Spider-Man
    
      <b>console.log(superhero[1].name);</b> // returns Iron Man;
          </pre>
        <p>
          One of the nice things about objects is that you can check to see if a
          property or method exsist.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>'city' in superman;</b> // returns false
      
      <b>superman.city !== undefined;</b> // returns false
      
      <b>superman.hasOwnProperty('city');</b> // returns false
      
      <b>superman.hasOwnProperty('name');</b> // returns true 
          </pre>
        <p>
          If there is a method in like there is in one of the examples above you
          can call it like this.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>superman.fly();</b> // returns 'Up, up and away!'
          </pre
        >
        <p>
          If you want to show all of the properties of the superman object from
          above, you would type:
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>for(const key in superman) {
            console.log(key + ": " + superman[key]);
          }
      </b>
      
      "name: Superman"
      "real name: Clark Kent"
      "height: 75"
      "weight: 235"
      "hero: true"
      "villain: false"
      "allies: Batman,Supergirl,Superboy"
      "fly: function (){
        console.log(\"Up, up and away!\");
      }"
          </pre>
        <p>You can add properties:</p>
        <pre>
      <b>supername.city = 'Metropolis';</b>
      'Metropolis'
          </pre>
        <p>You can remove properties:</p>
        <pre>
      <b>delete superman.fly</b>
      true
          </pre>
        <p>You can change properties:</p>
        <pre>
      <b>superman['real name'] = 'Kal-El';</b>
      'Kal-El'
          </pre>
        <p>
          You can even have nested objects which to me seems like it could be
          confusing. Maybe it won't if I get better at all this.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>const jla = {
          superman: { realName: 'Clark Kent' },
          batman: { realName: 'uce Wayne' },
          wonderWoman: { realName: 'Diana Prince" },
          flash: { realName: 'Barry Allen' },
          aquaman: { realName: 'Arthur Curry' },
        }</b>
      
        <b>jla.wonderWoman.realName</b>
        "Diana Prince"
          </pre>
        <p>
          There are other ways you can show each property names but I doubt I
          would ever use them. If you want to see it again look at page 178.
        </p>
        <p>You can even pass objects as parameters to functions.</p>
        <pre>
      <b>function greet({greeting,name,age}) {
          return `${greeting}! My name is ${name} and I am ${age}
          years old.`
      };</b>
        </pre>
        <p>The order of the parameters does not matter. Here is an example:</p>
        <pre>
      <b>greet({ greeting: `What's up dude`, age: 10, name: `Bart`});</b>
      'What\'s up dude! My name is Bart and I am 10 years old.'
        </pre>
        <p>You can also use defaults for some parameters:</p>
        <pre>
      <b>function greet({greeting='Hello',name,age=18}) {
        return `${greeting}! My name is ${name} and I am ${age}
        years old.`;
      }

      greet({ name: 'Lisa', age: 8 });</b>
      'Hello! My name is Lisa and I am 8 years old.'
        </pre>
        <p>
          This is pretty interesting. Since is it possible to reuse a function
          over and over again, for example square(), you can create what is
          called a namespace. I guess it has the potential of messing up things
          in a large program. To prevent this happening, we can place all our
          functions inside an object, thereby creating a namespace for them. In
          the example below, the namespace is myMaths, which is the name of the
          variable the object that contains the functions has been assigned to:
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>const myMaths = {
        square(x) {
          return x * x;
        },
        mean(array,callback) {
          if (callback) {
            array.map( callback );
          }
          const total = array.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
          return total/array.length;
        }
      };
    
      myMaths.square(3)</b>
      9
    
      <b>myStats.mean([1,2,3])</b>
      2
        </pre>
        <p><u>Creating Regular Expressions:</u></p>
        <p>
          There are two ways to create a regular expression.The first, and
          preferred way, is to use the literal notation of writing the regular
          expression between forward slashes that we’ve already seen:
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>const pattern = /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/;</b>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can create a new instance of the RegExp object
          using the new operator and a constructor function:
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>const pattern = new RegExp('[a-zA-Z]+ing');</b>
        </pre>

        <h2>The Document Object Model</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoyed DOM in WDD230. I did not realize I actually did some of this
          for my YaCIT page in college. It allows us to add and remove elements,
          change the order, content and attributes of elements and even alter
          how they are styled.
        </p>
        <p>This is done several ways:</p>
        <p>Getting An Element By Its ID</p>
        <pre>
      <b>const h1 = document.getElementById('title');</b>
        </pre>
        <p>Get Elements By Their Tag Name</p>
        <pre>
      <b>const listItems = document.getElementsByTagName('li');</b>
        </pre>
        <p>Get Elements By Their Class Name</p>
        <pre>
      <b>const heroes = document.getElementsByClassName('hero');</b>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Another way this can be done is by using Query Selectors. With the
          <b>document.querySelector()</b> method we can use CSS notation to find
          the first element in the document that matches the CSS selector
          provided as an argument. If there is not argument null will be
          returned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following code can be used instead of document.getElementById();
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>document.querySelector('#bats');</b>
      &#60;li class="vigilante hero" id="bats">Batman&#60;/li>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The following code can used instead of
          document.getElementsByClassName();
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>document.querySelectorAll('.hero');</b>
      NodeList [&#60;li class="hero">, &#60;li id="bats">, &#60;li class="hero">]
        </pre>
        <p>You can get very percise to specify items on a page:</p>
        <pre>
      <b>const wonderWoman = document.querySelector('li:last-child');</b> // returns only the last list item in the
      document

      <b>const ul = document.querySelector('ul#roster');</b> // get a reference to the &#60;ul> element

      <b>const batman = ul.querySelector('li#bats');</b> //finds an &#60;li> element with an id of 'bats':
        </pre>
        <p>
          If you had an element with the ID of 'roster' you could use
          <b>const heros = documentById('roster');</b> you could look to see all
          the child nodes. The childNodes property is a list of all the nodes
          that are children of the node concerned.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>const heroes = document.getElementById('roster');</b>

      heros.chileNodes
      NodeList [#text " ", &#60;li class="hero">, #text " ", &#60;li id="bats">, #text " ", &#60;li class="hero">, #text " ", &#60;li class="hero">, #text " ", ...]
        </pre>
        <p>
          The children property only returns any element nodes that are children
          of that node.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>heroes.children // this will only contain list items</b>
      HTMLCollection [&#60;li class="hero">, &#60;li id="bats">, &#60;li class="hero">, &#60;li class="hero">] (4)

      <b>heros.children.length</b>
      3
        </pre>
        <p>
          The firstChild property returns the first child of a node and
          lastChild property returns the last child of a node.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>heros.firstChild</b>
      #text " "

      <b>heros.lastChild</b>

        <br /><u>Getting And Setting An Element's Attributes:</u>
        <p>
          I don't remember getting an element but I do remember setting an
          element if it exsists.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>wonderWoman.getAttribute('class');</b>
      "hero"

      <b>wonderWoman.getAttribute('src');</b>
      null

      <b>wonderWoman.setAttribute('class', 'villain');</b>
      undefined

      <b>wonderWoman.getAttribute('class');</b>
      "villian"

      <b>wonderWoman.setAttribute('id','amazon');</b>

      <b>wonderWoman.getAttribute('id');</b>
      'amazon'

      <b>wonderWoman.id;</b> // legacy DOM allows access to attributes
      'amazon'

      <b>wonderWoman</b>
      &#60;li class="villain" id="amazon">Wonder Woman&#60;/li>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We can see use different methods (add(), remove(), toggle(),
          contains()) to update a className:
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>wonderWoman.className;</b>
      "villian"

      <b>wonderWoman.className = 'hero'</b>
      "hero"

      <b>wonderWoman.classList.add('warrior');</b>

      <b>wonderWoman.className;</b>
      "hero warrior"

      <b>wonderWoman.classList.remove('warrior');</b>

      <b>wonderWoman.classList.toggle('hero');</b> // will remove the 'hero' class
      false

      <b>wonderWoman.classList.toggle('hero');</b> // will add the 'hero' class back
      true 

      <b>wonderWoman.classList.contains('hero');</b>
      true

      <b>wonderWoman.classList.contains('villain');</b>
      false
        </pre>
        <br /><u>Creating Dynamic Markup</u><br />
        <p>
          I really enjoyed this part of WDD230 as well. You can create html
          based on things that are set in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>const flash = document.createElement('li');</b>

      <b>const flashText = document.createTextNode('Flash');</b>

      <b>flash.appendChild(flashText);</b>

      <b>const flash = document.createElement('li');
        flash.textContent = 'Flash';</b>
        </pre>
        <p>
          There is a shorter way to create elements. This is the one I used in
          WDD230.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <b>const aquaman = createElement('li','Aquaman');</b>
        </pre>
        <p><u>Adding elements to a page:</u></p>
        <pre>
      <b>heroes.appendChild(flash);</b>

      <b>heroes.insertBefore(aquaman,wonderWoman);</b>

      <b>heroes.insertAfter(wonderWoman,robin);</b>

      <b>heroes.appendChild(wonderWoman);</b> // if the wonderWoman element already exists, it will be removed and and added to at the end.
        </pre>
        <p>You can remove an element from or replace an element on a page:</p>
        <pre>
      <b>heroes.removeChild(aquaman);</b>
      &#60;li>Aquaman&#60;/li>

      <b>heros.replaceChild(newText,oldText);</b>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Here is something I have not see before that I can remember. You can
          update CSS from inside JavaScript.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <b>const heroes = document.getElementById('roster');
        const superman = heroes.children[0];
        
        superman.style.border = "red 2px solid";
      </b>
      "red 2px solid"

      <b>superman.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';</b>
      "blue"

      <b>superman.style.display = 'none';</b>
      "none"

      <b>superman.style.display = 'block';</b>
      "block"
        </pre>
        <p>
          The above section is mentioned to be used with caution. It says it is
          better to add a class and then go to the CSS stylesheet and add it.
        </p>
        <pre>
      <u>HTML</u>
      <b>superman.classList.add('highlighted');</b>

      <u>CSS Stylesheet</u>
      <b>.highlighted{
          border: red 2px solid;
        }</b>

        <h1>Notes from JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 7:</h1>
        <h2>Events</h2>
        <p>
          Events is another part of DOM (Document Object Model). It provides a
          link between the web page and the user interactions (clicking a link,
          pressing a key, or moving a mouse) which can be detected by the
          program and respond to. JavaScript uses event listeners to listen out
          for any clicks on the page. Everytime page is clicked, a callback
          function is called. This allows the program so do other things while
          it waits for the click event (click from the mouse, press of a key, or
          taps on the screen).
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);</b>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <u>Inline Event handler:</u> Inline attributes is the original way
          events are dealt with in the browser but is not recommended found on
          page 261.
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>&#60;p onclick="console.log('You Clicked Me!')">Click Me&#60;/p></b>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The event listeners is the current standard to dealing with events.
          method is called on a node object, the node to which the event
          listener is being applied.
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>document.body.addEventListener('click',doSomething);</b>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The addEventListener() method can also be called without a node, in
          which case it is applied to the global object, usually the whole
          browser window. In this example. we are adding a click event listener
          to the whole page. This is because addEventListener() method is called
          witout a node referenced after it.
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>addEventListener('click', () => alert('You Clicked!'));</b>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Another way of doing the same thing is by creating/declaring a
          function and reference it in the event listenr.
        </p>
        <pre>
    <b>function doSomething() {
      alert('You Clicked!');
    }
    
    addEventListener('click',doSomething);</b>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Because of time restraints to get homework done and things around the
          house, I don't have time to figure out a way to get these events to
          work in a smaller area. I can add a link to check out these examples.
          To get these working like I would like I can go back to the book (p.
          262 - 280).

        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>
          Comments: Understanding Objects is where I start getting lost. I don't
          really understand how to use the Objects. I can add elements (if that
          is what it is called) to an object, but I don't fully understand how
          to call them yet. I learn more hands one than reading from a book for
          the short period of time we are on each chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          So from the code I added with the superhero variable. When I typed
          <b>spiderman.f = reveal;</b>. Does that make <b>spiderman.f</b> a
          function now and it looks like this: <b>spiderman.f()</b>?
        </p>
        <p>How does the line of code know the numbers are between 1 & 6?</p>
        <pre>
      <b>const dice = {
        sides: 6,
        roll() {
          return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random()) + 1;
        }
      }</b>
