        Not sure what happened. When we started this activity, one person was
        scribe. For some reason it was not working. I was following as we went
        along and mine was working fine. We desided to let another person scribe
        but theirs was not working either. So I wrote the code down as we went
        through the activity. We would have had at least one of the harder ones
        done I am sure but we ran out of time and called it a night. Now for
        some reason mine is not working now but if you inspect the page you will
        see it does work. This is weird. If you know why please let us know.
        Thank you!
