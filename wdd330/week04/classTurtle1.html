    <main>
      <p>
        I have learned that I am a literal learner and thinker. I am hoping that
        by adding these next lines of code will help me understand how Objects
        work for future reference. I can try some of these in the console when I
        inspect this page. The following code is in the JS for this page.
        Inspect the page and you can try to type the code in bold letters to see
        it work.
      </p>
      <pre>
  class Turtle {
    constructor(name) {
      this.name = name;
      this.weapon = 'hands';
    }
    sayHi() {
      return `Hi dude, my name is ${this.name}`;
    }
    attack(){
      return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`;
    }
  }
      </pre>
      <p>Now we will create a new turtle instance.</p>
      <pre>
  <b>const leo = new Turtle('Leonardo');</b>
  &#60;&#60; Turtle { name: 'Leonardo' }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The variable leo points to an instance of the Turtle class. It has a
        name property and a sayHi() method that references the name property.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>leo.name;</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Leonardo'
  
  <b>leo.sayHi();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Hi dude, my name is Leonardo'
      </pre>
      <p>
        If you enter <b>leo.sayHi</b> you will get this instead of the desired
        result.
      </p>
      <pre>
  sayHi() {
    return `Hi dude, my name is ${this.name}`;
  }
      </pre>
      <p>
        We things we can see is the turtles name and weapon. We can add a method
        to the prototype:
      </p>
      <pre>
<b>
  Turtle.prototype.attack = function(){
    return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`;
  }
</b>
      </pre>
      <p>
        We have Leonado but lets add Raphael and display his information in the
        console.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>const raph = new Turtle('Raphael');</b>

  <b>raph.weapon = "ninjakens"</b>

  <b>raph.name;</b> 
  &#60;&#60; 'Raphael'

  <b>raph.sayHi();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Hi dude, my name is Raphael'

  <b>raph.attack();</b>
  `Feel the power of my ninjakens!`
      </pre>
      <u>Finding Out the Prototype</u>
      <p>There are a number of ways to find the prototype of an object:</p>
      <pre>
  // Each of these return the same thing 
  &#60;&#60; Turtle { attack: [Function], weapon: 'Hands' }
    
  <b>raph.constructor.prototype;</b> // Use the constructor function’s prototype property

  <b>Object.getPrototypeOf(raph);</b> // Use the Object.getPrototypeOf() method, which takes the
  object as a parameter

  // Many JavaScript engines also support the non-standard __proto__ property known as
  // double underscore proto or dunder proto. It seems it is getting replaced by the
  // isPrototypeOf() method
  <b>raph.__proto__;</b>

  // Every object also has a isPrototypeOf() method that returns a boolean to check
  if it’s the prototype of an instance
  <b>Turtle.prototype.isPrototypeOf(raph)</b>
  &#60;&#60; true
      </pre>
      <p>
        The object raph has access to both name and weapon properties, but the
        name property is considered to be its own property, while the weapon
        property is inherited from the prototype. Every object has a
        hasOwnProperty() method that can be used to check if a method is its own
        property, or is inherited from the prototype.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>raph.hasOwnProperty('name');</b>
  &#60;&#60; true

  <b>raph.hasOwnProperty('weapon');</b>
  &#60;&#60; false
      </pre>
      <p>
        Difference between an object’s own properties and prototype. Prototype
        properties are shared by every instance of the Turtle class. The objects
        all have the same properties. For example, every time an instance of the
        Turtle class queries the weapon property, it will return “Hands”.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>const don = new Turtle('Donatello');</b>
  &#60;&#60; Turtle { name: 'Donatello' }

  <b>don.weapon;</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Hands'

  <b>don.attack();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Feel the power of my Hands!'
      </pre>
      <p>
        Now supposedly we are able to change the weapon which seems to be
        'Hands' by default because of the way it is in the Turtle Class. I will
        put code here but so far I have not been able to get it to work.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>Turtle.prototype.weapon = 'Feet';</b> // This part works 
  &#60;&#60; 'Feet'
      </pre>
      <p>
        And the results are suppose to look like the following but I have not
        been able to get it to work. I keep getting 'Feel the power of my
        hands!'
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>leo.attack();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Feel the power of my Feet!'

  <b>raph.attack();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Feel the power of my Feet!'
  
  <b>don.attack();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Feel the power of my Feet!'
      </pre>
      <u> Overwriting Prototype Properties </u>
      <p>
        I like this part. We can change the weapon that each ninja turtle uses
        and it stays with that turtle. Right now the weapon SHOULD be feet but
        in my case so far, it is hands. But we will change them this way.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>leo.weapon = 'Katana Blades';</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Katana Blades'

  <b>raph.weapon = 'Sai';</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Sai'

  <b>don.weapon = 'Bo Staff';</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Bo Staff'
      </pre>
      <p>Now if we want to see the results we can do this:</p>
      <pre>
  <b>leo.attack();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Feel the power of my Katana Blades!'

  <b>raph.attack();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Feel the power of my Sai!'

  <b>don.attack();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Feel the power of my Bo Staff!'
      </pre>
      <p>
        Prototypes should be used to define any properties that will remain the
        same for every instance of the class. All of the turtles use different
        weapons but they all like the same food, pizza!
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>Turtle.prototype.food = 'Pizza';</b> // Adding Prototype property that is not in the original class declaration

  <b>Turtle.prototype.eat = function() { // Adding method to the prototype
    return 'Mmm, this ${this.food} tastes great!';
  }</b>
      </pre>
      <p>Now we can create another turtle instance.</p>
      <pre>
  <b>const mike = new Turtle('Michelangelo');</b>     

  <b>mike.eat();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Mmm, this Pizza tastes great!'

  <b>mike.weapon = 'Nunchakus';</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Nunchuks'

  <b>mike.attack();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Feel the power of my Nunchakus!'
      </pre>
      <u>Public and Private Methods</u>
      <p>
        Public methods and properties can be queried directly and changed by
        assignment even after it has been created. The name and weapon
        properties are said to be public in this example because we can query
        their value and they can be changed. giving users or external services
        too much access to properties and methods could be a recipe for
        disaster!
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>raph.weapon;</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Sai'

  <b>raph.weapon = 3;</b>
  &#60;&#60; 3

  <b>raph.attack();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Feel the power of my 3!'
      </pre>
    </main>
