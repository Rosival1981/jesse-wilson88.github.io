      <p>
        The concept of variable scope can be used to keep some properties and
        methods private inside a class declaration. This will prevent the user
        from accessing or changeing the methods and/or properties.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <a href="classTurtle2.html" target="_blank">class Turtle</a> {
    constructor(name,color) {
      this.name = name;
      let _color = color;
      this.setColor = color => { return _color = color; }
    this.getColor = () => _color;
    }
  }
      </pre>
      <p>
        By creating the _color property inside the scope of the constructor
        function inside the class declaration. It makes it impossible to access
        outside of this scope. The getColor() and setColor are known as getter
        and setting methods.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>raph = new Turtle('Raphael','Red');</b>
  &#60;&#60; Turtle { name: 'Raphael', setColor: [Function], getColor: [Function] }

  <b>raph.getColor();</b>
  &#60;&#60; 'Red'

  <b>raph.setColor(4);</b>
  &#60;&#60; 4

  // You can also insist that the color property is a string
  this.setColor = (color) => {
    if(typeof color === 'string'){
      return _color = color;
    } else {
      throw new Error('Color must be a string');
    }
  }

  <b>raph.setColor(4);</b>
  &#60;&#60; Error: Color must be a string
      </pre>
      <u>The Prototype Chain</u>
      <p>
        An example of a prototype chain by looking at the prototype of the raph
        instance of the Turtle class that we created in the last section, using
        the Object.getPrototypeOf() method:
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>Object.getPrototypeOf(raph);</b>
  &#60;&#60; Turtle {}
      </pre>
      <p>
        We can peer further down the prototype chain, but calling the
        Object.getPrototypeOf() method recursively. This shows us that the
        prototype of the prototype is an apparently empty object literal,
        although it’s actually an instance of the built-in Object() constructor
        function
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(raph))</b>
  &#60;&#60; {}
      </pre>

      </figure>
      <u>The Object Constructor</u>
      <p>
        All objects ultimately inherit from the prototypeof the Object()
        constructor function. Here is what happens when an object calls a
        method:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          JavaScript engine will check to see if the object has that method
        </li>
        <li>
          If it doesn’t, it will check if the object’s prototype has the method
        </li>
        <li>If not, it will check whether the prototype’s prototype has it</li>
        <li>
          It will continue all the way up the prototype chain, until it reaches
          the prototype of the Object() constructor function
        </li>
        <li>
          If the prototype of Object() is without the method, an error will be
          returned saying the object doesn’t exist
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The prototype of the Object constructor function has a large number of
        methods that are inherited by all objects. The reason why the prototype
        appears as an empty object literal is because all of its methods are not
        enumerable. Properties of objects in JavaScript are said to be
        enumerable or non-enumerable. If they aren’t enumerable, this means they
        will not show up when a for-in loop is used to loop through an object’s
        properties and methods. There is a method called propertyIsEnumerable()
        that every object has (because it's a methos of Object.prototype) that
        is used to check if a property is enumerable.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>Turtle.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable('eat');</b>
  &#60;&#60; true

  <b>Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable('toString');</b>
  &#60;&#60; false

  <b>Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable('propertyIsEnumerable');</b>
  &#60;&#60; false
