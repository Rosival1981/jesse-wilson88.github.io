      <u>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</u>
      <p>
        Errors are caused by one of the following when something goes wrong in
        the program:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices
          with which the program is interacting
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty
          logic; it could even be as simple as a typo
        </li>
        <li>
          User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program
          is unable to handle
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As prorammers, we have little influence how external systems work but we
        should be aware of them and attempt to reduce ther impact. Programmer
        errors are our responsibility, so we must ensure they are minimized as
        much as possible and fixed promptly. We should try to limit user errors
        by predecting any possible interactions that may throw an error, and
        ensure they are dealt with in a way that doesn’t negatively affect the
        user experience. It might even be argued that user errors are in fact
        also programmer errors, because the program should be designed in a way
        that prevents the user from making the error.
      </p>
      <u>Exceptions</u>
      <p>
        An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be
        used by the program to deal with the error. One example is calling a
        method that does not exsist. This is what it looks like when you call a
        method that does not exsist:
      </p>
      <pre>
  unicorn();
  &#60;&#60; ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined
      </pre>
      <p>
        An exception will produce a stack trace. It looks like it is set up to
        work backwards as you will see in the example below. It is usually one
        function or method that will cause the error. In this example, we have
        three functions: function one()invokes function two(), which then
        invokes function three(). Function three()then invokes the
        unicorn()function that doesn't exist and causes an error. We can use the
        stack trace to work backwards and see that this error was caused by
        invoking the function one()in the first place:
      </p>
      <pre>
  function three(){ unicorn(); } // calls function unicorn which is undefined
  function two(){ three(); } // calls function three
  function one(){ two(); } // calls function two
  one(); // calls function one

  &#60;&#60; index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined
     at three (index.html:13)
     at two (index.html:17)
     at one (index.html:21)
     at index.html:24`
      </pre>
      <p>
        A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to
        cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run
        after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be problematic, since
        the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to continue
        running incorrectly. An example of a mistake that could cause a warning
        is assigning a value to a variable that’s undeclared:
      </p>
      <pre>
  pi = 3.142;
  &#60;&#60; JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared variable

  let pi = 3.142;
  &#60;&#60; 3.142
      </pre>
      <p>
        Warnings and exceptions are presented differently in various
        environments. Some browsers will show a small icon in the corner of the
        browser window to indicate that an exception or warning has occurred.
        Others require the console to be open to see any warnings or exceptions.
      </p>
      <u>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</u>
      <p>
        I have worked in the DISA for four years and in the IT field longer. The
        hardest thing is troubleshooting and replicating the problem. Javascript
        can be a fairly forgiving language. exceptions were not implemented
        until ECMAScript version 3. If no alert is given, the error might give
        unexpectd or incorrect results that no one spots and may run in the
        background for some time before the program crashes. To help programmers
        should encure their code fails loud so it can be identified and fixed
        quickly.
      </p>
      <u>Strict Mode</u>
      <p>
        Increasing the chance of errors might seem like a bad idea at first, but
        it’s much better to spot errors early on, rather than have them cause
        problems later. Writing code in strict mode can also help improve its
        clarity and speed, since it follows conventions and will throw
        exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used. I find it interesting
        that not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode'. I am
        not sure how you know there are problems in the code by using 'use
        strict' but I will see when and if I use it. Here are three examples of
        how 'use strict' can be used:
      </p>
      <pre>
  'use strict';

  e = 2.718;
  &#60;&#60; ReferenceError: e is not defined
      </pre>
      <p>
        By adding the line inside a function, strict mode will then only be
        applied to anything inside that function.
      </p>
      <pre>
  function strictly(){
    'use strict';
    // function code goes here
  }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into
        a self-invoking function.
      </p>
      <pre>
  (function() {
    'use strict';

    // All your code would go inside this function
  
  }());
      </pre>
      <u>Linting Tools</u>
      <p>
        Linting tools such asJS Lint,JS Hint,andES Lintcan be used to test the
        quality of JavaScript code. They are designed to highlight any sloppy
        programming practices or syntax errors, and can be very unforgiving.
        It's possible to add a linting tool as a text-editor plugin; this will
        then highlight any sloppy code as you type. For more information about
        ESLint go to
