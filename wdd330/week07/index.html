      <h1>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h1>
      <u>Function Properties and Methods</u>
      <p>
        Functions are first-class objects that can have properties and methods
        themselves.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>function square(x) {
    return x*x;
  }</b>

  // We can query the length property and see that is accepts one parameter.
  <b>square.length</b> 
  << 1
      </pre>
      <u>Call and Apply Methods</u>
      <p>
        The call() method can be used to set the value of
        <b><i>this</i></b> inside a function to an object that is provided as
        the first argument. Below is an example of the sayHello() function which
        refers to an unspecific object called <b><i>this</i></b> that has a
        property called name:
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>function sayHello(){
    return `Hello, my name is ${ <i>this</i>.name }`;
  }</b>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Multiple objects can have the same property (ex name) and use the call()
        method to invoke the sayHello() function providing each object as an
        argument. This will then take the value of <b><i>this</i></b> in the
        function:
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>const clark = { name: 'Clark' };
  const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' };</b>

  <b>sayHello.call(clark);</b>
  << 'Hello, my name is Clarke'

  <b>sayHello.call(bruce);</b>
  << 'Hello, my name is Bruce'
      </pre>
      <p>
        Now if we were to update the sayHello() function to give a more
        generalized greeting that is provided as an argument. If we call a
        functoin that requires any parameters we need to provide those as an
        argument, which is always the value of <b><i>this</i></b
        >. This is how it could look like if we updated the sayHello() function
        that is provided as an argument.
      </p>
      <pre>
  <b>function sayHello(greeting='Hello'){ // Greetings is a default argument
    return `${ greeting }, my name is ${ <i>this</i>.name }`;
  }</b>
  
  <b>sayHello.call(clark, 'How do you do');</b>
  << 'How do you do, my name is Clark'

  sayHello.call(bruce);
  << 'Hello, my name is Bruce'
      </pre>
      <p>
        Function can sill be called using the call method even if it does not
        refer to an object as the <b><i>this</i></b> in its body. We will use
        the square function from above. Because <b><i>this</i></b> is not in its
        body, we need to make the first argument null.
      </p>
      <pre>
<b>square.call(null, 4)</b>
<< 16
      </pre>
      <p>
        The apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the
        function are provided as an array, even if there is only one argument:
      </p>
      <pre>
<b>square.apply(null, [4])</b>
<< 16
      </pre>
      <u>Custom Properties</u>
      <p>
        We can add our own properties to functions the same way we add
        properties to any object in JS. Here we will add the description
        property to a function that describes what it does.
      </p>
      <pre>
  square.description = 'Squares a number that is provided as an argument'
  << 'Squares a number that is provided as an argument'
      </pre>
      <u>Memoization</u>
      <p></p>

      <!-- This is where my questions are added. This is to help me know that I will be continuing my notes above this sectin. -->
      <h2>Questions:</h2>
      <p>
        When would you use the description property to describe what a function
        does? When would you see it. I thought that was why we put comments in
        our code.
